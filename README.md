Add this Board Manager entry into your Arduino Preferences (additional boards URL) to add the STM32 boards to the Arduino IDE

So you're up for a boost to your Arduino UNO or Nano processor? The STM32 acts just like a Nano but has more pins, more capabilities and is cheap! There is a vibrant support community and you keep your Arduino IDE to code your sketches.

I'll be exploring all these features in more depths in future videos but for now this is a brief overview and comparison to ÂµControllers we've already covered in previous videos. Exciting Times!

Here are some links that I found very easily - do search around for the best price. China is keenest in price (but read the reviews of the products to check the quality), Amazon also sometimes has hobbyist priced stuff and eBay is always a good place to search.  

* Some of these links are afilliate links that may help my channel. *
